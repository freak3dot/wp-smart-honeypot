wp-smart-honeypot
=================

Wordpress plugin to reduce comment spam with a smarter honeypot.


###New Comment Template Required###

The trickiest thing here is make sure the comment form is done in the
new style in your comment form. Since this plugin rearranges form
fields, it requires the newer comment template.

###Trackback Spam###
The website still gets trackback spam. That's harder to figure out a
solution, because a trackback is sort of meant to be done by computers.
Really the only solution for trackback spam is to turn off trackbacks.
This plugin is not intended to stop trackback spam.
